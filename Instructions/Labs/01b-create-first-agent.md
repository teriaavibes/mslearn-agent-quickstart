# Develop your first AI agent in Microsoft Foundry

![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Hi, I'm Anton.**<br/>I'll be here to help you with hints and tips as you work through this lab; in which you'll use Microsoft Foundry to develop an AI agent that provides information and expertise on the history of computing.

If you want more interactive help, you can chat with me in the *[Ask Anton](https://aka.ms/choose-anton){:target="_blank"}* app.

<details>
<strong><i><a href="https://aka.ms/choose-anton" target="_blank">Ask Anton</a></i></strong> is a generative AI agent that can answer questions about AI concepts and Microsoft Foundry technologies. It's available in two versions at <code>https://aka.ms/choose-anton</code>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure-based</strong>: Best experience <i>(requires an Azure subscription and deployment of a model in a Foundry project)</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Browser-based</strong>: Use a small language model in your browser <i>(reduced functionality - may be slow or work only in "basic" mode in older/lower-spec devices)</i>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><i>Ask Anton is <u>not</u> a supported Microsoft product or a component of Microsoft Learn or AI Skills Navigator.</i>
</blockquote>

This exercise should take approximately **40** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: Many components of Microsoft Foundry, including the Microsoft Foundry portal, are subject to continual development. This reflects the fast-moving nature of artificial intelligence technology. Some elements of your user experience may differ from the images and descriptions in this exercise!

## Create an agent in the Microsoft Foundry portal

Microsoft Foundry uses *projects* to organize models, resources, data, and other assets used to develop an AI solution.

1. In a web browser, open [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com){:target="_blank"} at `https://ai.azure.com` and start building; signing in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page.

1. If it is not already enabled, in the tool bar the top of the page, enable the **New Foundry** option. Then, if prompted, create a new project with a unique name; expanding the  **Advanced options** area to specify the following settings for your project:
    - **Foundry resource**: *A valid name for your Foundry resource.*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create or select a resource group*
    - **Region**: Select any of the **AI Foundry recommended** regions in [this list](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/responses#supported-regions){:target="_blank"}

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: Depending on your permissions in the Azure subscription, you may need to clear the option to set up recommended resources.

1. Wait for your project to be created. It may take a few minutes. Then close any welcome dialogs that are displayed.

    After creating or selecting a project in the new Foundry portal, it should open in a page similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of the Foundry project home page.](./media/foundry-portal-home.png)

### Deploy a model

At the heart of every AI agent, there's a large language model (LLM). Let's find one in the Foundry models catalog.

1. Now you're ready to explore models. On the **Discover** page, select the **Models** tab to view the Microsoft Foundry model catalog.

    Microsoft Foundry provides a large collection of models from Microsoft, OpenAI, and other providers, that you can use in your AI apps and agents.

    ![Screenshot of the AI Foundry model catalog.](./media/0-foundry-models.png)

1. Search for and select the `gpt-5-mini` model, and view the page for this model, which describes its features and capabilities.

    ![Screenshot of the gpt-5-mini model page.](./media/gpt-5-mini.png)

1. Use the **Deploy** button to deploy the model using the default settings. Deployment may take a minute or so.

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: Model deployments are subject to regional quotas. If you don't have enough quota to deploy the model in your project's region, you can use a different *gpt* chat-capable model - such as *gpt-5-nano*, or *gpt-5.4-mini*. Alternatively, you can create a new project in a different region.

1. When the model has been deployed, view the model playground page that is opened, in which you can chat with the model.

    ![Screenshot of the model playground.](./media/0-model-playground.png)

### Chat with the model

You can use the playground to explore the model by chatting with it.

1. Use the button at the bottom of the left navigation pane to hide it and give yourself more room to work with.
1. In the **Chat** pane, enter a prompt such as `Who was Ada Lovelace?`, and review the response.

    ![Screenshot of the chat pane with a response.](./media/0-chat-response.png)

1. Enter a follow-up prompt, such as `Tell me more about her work with Charles Babbage.` and review the response.

    Generative AI chat applications often include the conversation history in the prompt; so the context of the conversation is retained between messages. In this case, "her" is interpreted as referring to Ada Lovelace.

1. At the top-right of the chat pane, use the **New chat** button to restart the conversation. This removes all conversation history.
1. Enter a new prompt, such as `Tell me about the ELIZA chatbot.` and view the response.
1. Continue the conversation with prompts such as `How does it compare with modern LLMs?`.

### Specify instructions in a *system prompt*

To support specific use cases, you should use a *system prompt* to provide the model with instructions that guide its responses. You can use the system prompt to give the model a specific focus or role, and provide guidelines about format, style, and constraints about what the model should and should not include in its responses.

1. In the model playground, at the top-right of the chat pane, use the **New chat** button to restart the conversation and remove the conversation history.
1. In the pane on the left, in the **Instructions** text area, change the system prompt to:

    ```
   You are an expert in the history of computing and AI. You only answer questions about significant people and events in the development of computing, and about notable vintage computers. Do not engage in conversations on any topic that is unrelated to computing history.
    ```

1. Now enter a new user prompt related to computing history, such as `What was Alan Turing's contribution to the development of AI?`

    Review the response, which should provide some history of computing information.

1. Try asking an "off-topic" question, such as `What's the capital of Spain?`; and view the response.

### Add a web_search tool

A model generally answers questions based on the data with which it was trained. While this is useful, that leaves out a lot of current information on the web; which might help the model give more relevant answers. You can use *tools* to give models access to external data sources and enable them to perform custom tasks. The *web_search* tool enables the model to search the Web for up-to-date information.

> **Note**: The *web_search* tool may be enabled for your model by default.

1. In the pane on the left, under the instructions, expand the **Tools** section if it is not already expanded.
1. In the **Add** drop-down list, if it is not already enabled, select **Web search**. Then confirm the tool is added to the list of tools, and use its **{i)** icon to read the information about the tool.
1. After adding the *web_search* tool, in the chat pane, enter the prompt `Find a vintage computer store near Seattle` (*or your local city!*) and review the response.

    The model should have searched the Web for vintage computer stores near the specific city.

### Save the model configuration as an agent

While you can implement generative AI apps using a standalone model, to create a fully agentic AI experience, you need to encapsulate the model, its instructions, and any tool configuration that provides additional functionality, in an *agent*.

1. In the model playground, at the top right select **Save as agent**. Then, when prompted, name your new agent `computing-historian`.

    When the agent is created, it opens in a new playground specifically for working with agents.

    ![Screenshot of the agent playground.](./media/agent-playground.png)

1. In the pane on the right, view the **YAML** tab, which contains the definition for your agent. Note that its definition includes the model, its parameter settings, and the instructions you specified - similar to this:

    ```yml
    metadata:
      logo: Avatar_Default.svg
      microsoft.voice-live.enabled: "false"
    object: agent.version
    id: computing-historian:1
    name: computing-historian
    version: "1"
    description: ""
    created_at: 1782917197
    definition:
      kind: prompt
      model: gpt-5-mini
      instructions: You are an expert in the history of computing and AI. You only answer questions about significant people and events in the development of computing, and about notable vintage computers. Do not engage in conversations on any topic that is unrelated to computing history.
      tools:
        - type: web_search
    status: active
    instance_identity:
      principal_id: c51143c7-2c5e-4d70-a7c1-759539926623
      client_id: c51143c7-2c5e-4d70-a7c1-759539926623
    blueprint:
      principal_id: 3a9a2794-b482-42f9-8b52-f7c0f80d2520
      client_id: e70779c8-c3ce-49c6-8ca6-8ea5037e9738
    blueprint_reference:
      type: ManagedAgentIdentityBlueprint
      blueprint_id: computing-historian-13bf1
    agent_guid: 13bf1394-7dfe-4c03-94b7-3e81a168d770
    ```

1. Switch back to the **Chat** tab, and enter the prompt `Who are you?`

    The response should indicate that the agent is "aware" of its role as a computing historian.

### Preview the agent

Now you have a working agent, you can preview it in a basic web chat application.

1. At the top of the chat pane, in the **Publish** drop-down list, select **Preview web app**.

    A preview chat interface is opened in a new browser tab.

1. Enter a prompt, such as `What can you tell me about the Altair 8800?` and view the response from your agent.

    ![Screenshot of an agent preview chat interface.](./media/agent-preview.png)

1. When you've finished testing the agent, close the tab containing the preview app to return to your agent in the Foundry portal

## Develop a client app for the agent

So far you've developed and tested your agent within a Foundry project. To take it into production, you need to write code that consumes it from its dedicated endpoint. That means you can move beyond playground testing and start integrating the agent into a real user experience.

1. In the **computing-historian** agent page in the Foundry portal, view the **Details** tab. In particular, note the **Responses** protocol endpoint that clients apps can use to call your agent via the OpenAI Responses API. You'll need this later!

### Configure a client application in Visual Studio Code

A partially completed client application for your agent has been provided. You'll complete this app and test it with your agent endpoint.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: If you're new to Visual Studio Code, you can refer to the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs){:target="_blank"} at `https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs` for help.

1. Open the command palette (*Ctrl+Shift+P* or on the **View** menu, select **Command Palette**) and enter the `Git:clone` command to clone the `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-agent-quickstart` repo to a local folder (it doesn't matter which one).
1. After the clone operation is complete, open the folder when prompted.

    You may be prompted to confirm you trust the authors.

1. In the Activity bar on the left edge, view the **Extensions** pane; and if it is not already installed, search for and install the **Python** extension.
1. In the **Command Palette**, use the command `python:create envionment`(or `python:select interpreter`) to create a new **Venv** environment based on your Python 3.1x installation.

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: You can choose to install the workspace dependencies in the *requirements.txt* file as you create the environment. Don't worry of you accidentally skip this though; we'll do it in a later step anyway.

    Wait for the environment to be created. It may take a while, and some notifications may be displayed during the process.

1. In the Activity bar, switch back to the **Explorer** pane, and navigate to the folder containing the application code files at **/computer-history-client**. The application files include:
    - **.env** (the application configuration file)
    - **agent_client.py** (the code file for the Python code to interact with your agent)
    - **app.py** (the main code file for a Python Flask-based web application)
    - **requirements.txt** (the Python package dependencies that need to be installed)
1. In the **Explorer** pane, right-click the **agent_client.py** file, and select **Open in integrated terminal**.

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: Opening the terminal in Visual Studio Code should automatically activate the Python environment after a few seconds. If you're using a PowerShell terminal, you may need to enable running scripts on your system (see [Set-ExecutionPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy){:target="_blank"}). If for any reason the Python environment is not activated automatically, you can use [this query](https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22How%20do%20I%20activate%20a%20Python%20venv%22){:target="_blank"} to search for information on how to activate it in your environment.

1. Ensure that the terminal is open in the **/computer-history-client** folder with the prefix **(.venv)** to indicate that the Python environment you created is active.
1. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

    ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. In the **Explorer** pane, in the **/computer-history-client** folder, select the **.env** file to open it. Then update the configuration values to replace *your_agent_endpoint_url* with the **Responses API endpoint** for your published agent.

1. Save the updated **.env** file.

### Add code to interact with your agent

Now you're ready to implement the code that will submit prompts to your agent.

1. In the **Explorer** pane, in the **/computer-history-client** folder, select the **agent_client.py** file (<u>not</u> *app.py*) to open it.
1. Review the existing code. You will add code to use the OpenAI Response API to interact with your agent.

    > ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: As you add code to the code file, be sure to maintain the correct indentation.

1. Find the comment **Import Azure Identity and OpenAI client libraries**, and add the following code to import the Azure Identity classes required to use Entra ID authentication, and the OpenAI library.

    ```python
   # Import Azure Identity and OpenAI client libraries
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
   from openai import OpenAI
    ```

1. In the **AgentClient** class, in the ****init**** function, note that code has been provided to load the agent endpoint from the environment configuration file. Then find the comment **Create OpenAI client authenticated with Azure credentials** and add the following code to create an authenticated OpenAI client for your agent:

    ```python
   # Create OpenAI client authenticated with Azure credentials 
   self.client = OpenAI(
        api_key=get_bearer_token_provider(
            DefaultAzureCredential(), 
            "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
        ),
        base_url=self.agent_endpoint,
        default_query={"api-version": "v1"}
   )
    ```

1. In the **send_message** function, note that code to add the user's prompt to the conversation history has been provided. Then, in the **try** block, find the comment **Send prompt with full conversation history and get response** and add the following code to submit the prompt to the agent and get the response.

    ```python
   # Send prompt with full conversation history and get response
   response = self.client.responses.create(
        input=self.conversation_history
   )
   assistant_message = response.output_text
    ```

1. Read through the rest of the code, using the comments to understand the technique of tracking user inputs and responses in a conversation history.
1. Save the updated **agent_client.py** file.

### Run the client application

Now you're ready to test the app with your agent.

1. In the terminal, use the following command to sign into Azure.

    ```powershell
   az login
    ```

1. When prompted, follow the instructions to sign into Azure. Then complete the sign in process in the command line, viewing (and confirming if necessary) the details of the subscription containing your Foundry resource.
1. After you have signed in, enter the following command to run the application:

    ```powershell
   python app.py
    ```

1. When the Flask application starts, open your browser and navigate to the URL where it is running - for example, [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

    The application web site should look like this:

    ![Screenshot of the computing history agent.](./media/client-app.png)

1. Enter a prompt, such as `What was ENIAC?` and view the response.
1. Follow up with a second prompt, such as `How does it compare with COLOSSUS?`
1. Try more prompts, like `Find the latest news for vintage computer enthusiasts.`

    Your agent should use its knowledge and tools to provide useful information and insights into computing history related topics.

1. When you've finished testing the app, close the browser, and in Visual Studio, enter **CTRL+C** in the terminal pane, to stop the local web server.

### Use GitHub Copilot to enhance the application

GitHub Copilot provides agentic AI assistance in Visual Studio Code, helping you develop applications more efficiently.

> ![Image of Anton.](./media/anton-icon.png)<br/>**Tip**: GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code requires that you are signed in using a GitHub account. While agentic assistance is available in all GitHub plans, including free accounts, there are usage limitations.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Extensions** pane, ensure that the **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension is installed and enabled.
1. At the bottom of the activity bar on the left, select **Accounts** and ensure that you are signed into your GitHub account. If not, sign in to use AI features.
1. On the toolbar, next to the search box, use the **Toggle Chat** button to show the chat pane on the right.

    ![Screenshot of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.](./media/vscode-github-copilot.png)

    The **Chat** pane is where you configure and use GitHub Copilot and connected agents to assist you with development tasks. You can select the model that GitHub Copilot uses, configure tools, and add custom agents. We'll use the default settings in this exercise.

1. In the **Explorer** pane, in the **/computer-history-client** folder, select **feature-spec.md** and read its contents.

    This file contains a specification for a new feature that enables users to upload an image and submit it to the agent along with a text-based prompt.

1. With the specification file still open, in the Chat pane, enter the following prompt for GitHub Copilot.

    ```
    Use the feature spec to add an image identification feature to the computer hstory client app.
    ```

1. Enter the prompt, and wait while GitHub Copilot reviews and modifies your code. Eventually the changes will be staged and displayed.

    ![Screenshot of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.](./media/vscode-modified-code.png)

1. With the changes staged, in the terminal, re-run the code (`python app.py`), and then open your browser and navigate to the URL where it is running.

1. In the revised version of the app, upload one of the images from the **/test-images** folder (which is in the folder where you cloned the repo); and enter the prompt `What can you tell me about this?`

1. Review the response, which should provide information about the computer in the image you uploaded.

1. Try the other images in the *test-images* folder with prompts like `What about this?` or `Tell me about this.`
1. When you've finished testing the app, close the browser, and in Visual Studio, enter **CTRL+C** in the terminal pane, to stop the local web server.

1. If you're happy with the code that GitHub Copilot has generated, use the **Keep** button in the **Chat** pane to confirm the changes.

## Summary

In this exercise, you built a client application that uses an agent you developed in Microsoft Foundry.

If you have finished exploring Microsoft Foundry, you should delete the Azure resources created in this lab to avoid unnecessary utilization charges.
